# kickstater_sql_project
This was my admission challenge for Data Science Bootcamp at Brainstation! ðŸ˜Š

In this challenge we had to analyze Kickstater campaings were succesfull or failed, number of backers, which countries that backed campaigns, etc.

The questions we had to answer for the challenge are present in the code.
